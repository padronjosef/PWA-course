# PWA course

This is all the resource code of the [PWA course of Fernando Herrera](https://www.udemy.com/course/aplicaciones-web-progresivas/), with some personal modifications to make the code a little bit readable.

# How to run the projects.
Every folder is a section of the course, you'll need to install the dependices:

1. Run the command `yarn` : to inicialize the project dependencies.
2. Run the command `yarn run dev` : to start the development environment.
